# Wireless EMG and IMU Sleeve for Hand Gesture Recognition

We are looking to create a system which tracks arm movements and recognizes hand gestures for more immersive Virtual Reality (VR) Environments. Specifically, we are going to develop a wireless sleeve lined with Electromyography (EMG) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors in order to detect electrical signals, orientation, and acceleration information from a user's arm and use on-device processing of machine learning algorithms to classify individual finger gestures and track arm movement.
